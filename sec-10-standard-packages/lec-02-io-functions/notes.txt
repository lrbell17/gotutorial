io.Copy()
- copy bytes from io.Reader to io.Writer
    - An error on read or write will stop the copy
    - however, EOF on io.Reader value is not considered an error 

io.Pipe() 
- creates an 'in-memory' reader and writer
- returns connected reader and writer
- operates sort of like a channel

Producer -- writer -- pipe -- reader --> Consumer
